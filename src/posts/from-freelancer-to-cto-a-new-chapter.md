Hey Flutter devs and tech enthusiasts!

Enzo here, today I want to share a significant shift in my professional journey.
After 7 years as a freelance developer, where I've had the pleasure of collaborating on many Flutter projects (Canonical, Betclic Group, Chili Publish and many more) and pushing the boundaries of Flutter on mobile, desktop and on embedded devices; I've made a big move, and I've joined one of my long-time clients as a full-time employee as their CTO!

### Why the shift?

Freelancing has been an incredible ride. I've enjoyed unmatched flexibility in time, tackled numerous technical challenges, and connected with amazing people around the globe. 
However, as a freelancer, juggling between multiple projects, deadlines, and clients was exhilarating but often hectic.
Shifting from a freelancing career to a full-time job was never on my radar until recently: for years, the freedom of freelancing matched my lifestyle perfectly, allowing me to choose projects that piqued my interest. The thought of anchoring myself to a single company, a single team, didn't appeal to me until it suddenly did.

Joining as the CTO of a company I've freelanced with for over 3 years isn't just about stability: it's about committing to a team I deeply believe in. Itâ€™s a chance to work on projects I'm passionate about and to help establish the company's tech direction at a higher level.

Sure, the steady paycheck of a full-time job might not match the peaks of a successful freelance project, but not everything is about money. This move was more about investing in my own career growth and diving deeper into projects I like to work on, as it's not always the case as a freelancer.

### My journey (hopefully inspiring but not egocentric)

Reflecting on my journey from a freelance developer to the CTO of a thriving company, itâ€™s a narrative that I hope inspires those starting their tech careers as Iâ€™m reminded that everyoneâ€™s journey in tech can be unique and inspiring.

I immersed myself in the world of technology with little more than a laptop, a CS master, and a great deal of curiosity. Over the years, I dedicated countless hours to mastering Flutter, contributing to open source, and sharing knowledge at conferences and meetups.

My career path wasnâ€™t just about coding: it was about creating connections, continuously learning, and adapting to new challenges. This hands-on, community-focused approach eventually led me to a pivotal role as CTO, where I now guide our company's technological vision.

### Why making an article about it?

Well, firstly because I can, and I mostly write for myself!
But most importantly, this isn't just a new job; it's BIG, at least for me, since this is the next chapter in my tech career, and I'm excited about it.

For those finding themselves in a similar position or curious about balancing freelance and full-time opportunities, remember: it's all about finding the right fit for your career goals and lifestyle.
Whether you're freelancing or an employee, staying passionate and proactive is key!

And while I'll always cherish my freelancing days for their spontaneity and invaluable lessons, Iâ€™m thrilled about the extended, steady path ahead in my new role.

I cannot wait to speak about what *we* do at Ezymob at my next conferences ðŸ‘€
