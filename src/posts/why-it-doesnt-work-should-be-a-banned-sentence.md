title: Why "It doesn't work" should be a banned sentence.

## The problem

**Every day**, I heard someone on some Discord, Slack, StackOverflow or even on some Jira tickets saying:

> "I'm trying to do `X` and it doesn't work".

And if you recognize yourself in this sentence, you need to stop saying that. Even if you're not an IT person.

## Why ?

Firstly, because this message is pointless ! You didn't give any context on your problem. We have no idea of what doesn't work:

In my mind, I have at least a few more questions on your issue:

What did you tried ?
Did you get an error ?
What is the result you expected ?
Do you have documentation ?
Did you google the error ?
If yes, what did you tried then ?

Secondly, it can also be seen that you're lazy because you're not providing any useful information on your problem.
A lot of people will not help you because they need to start sending you messages asking you for more details to try to understand the situation and it's time-consuming, even if you reply quickly.
It's still a lot of time wasted for both you and the people that are trying to help you.
You can also refer to <https://dontasktoask.com/> to describe correctly your first message.

Finally, if you're not providing enough information, you will maybe face the [X/Y problem](https://xyproblem.info/): to describe it shortly it's when you ask how to do something (X), and somebody tells you to do something else (Y), but your original problem hasn't been solved.

## The solution

In summary, you should stop saying:

> "I'm trying to do X and it doesn't work".

But say:

> "I'm trying to do X, I got this error, I tried Y, but I can't find a solution to my problem"

By doing so, you have a higher chance of reply, a higher chance of find help, and a higher chance to fix your problem.
